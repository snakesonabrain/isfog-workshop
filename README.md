ISFOG - Data science 101 - Pre-conference workshop
========================================================

This Python package contains tutorial notebooks and assignments for the ISFOG Data Science 101 workshop.

groundhog bundles a large amount of knowledge and provides it to end users through extensively documented functions. The aim of the package is as follows:

   - Improve correctness through unit-tested functions with parameter validation
   - Raise awareness on underlying test data and theories supporting engineering correlations and design formulae
   - Promoting development of open-source engineering software by the worldwide community of engineers

For more background on the problems included in this workshop, consult the keynote paper on Data science in offshore geotechnics (Stuyts, 2020).

Installation requirements
-------------------------

This package is written for Python 3.7+. Downloading Anaconda3 is recommended for users not familiar with Python development. Plotting functionality included in the package is built on plotly. The plotly package also needs to be installed and is sometimes not included in the default Anaconda installation.

The notebooks can also be run in an installation-free environment through binder.
